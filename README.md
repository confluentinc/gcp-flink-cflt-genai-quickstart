# GenAI Healthcare Quickstart
Welcome to the GCP Healthcare QuickStart! This repository provides a comprehensive guide to quickly deploy a fully functional Natural Language Voice Assistant
 for healthcare. The solution leverages **Confluent
Cloud** and **GCP** to deliver a scalable, intelligent, and real-time conversational
experience.



## Key Features
[//]: <> (change the key concepts accordingly)
* **Real-Time Data Processing**: Powered by Confluent Cloud and Kstreams App, ensuring low-latency communication and
  event-driven architecture.
* **Intelligent Conversations**: Integrated with GCP Gemini AI models for natural and accurate conversational
  responses.
* **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Leverages BigQuery with vector search capabilities for quick and accurate document indexing and retrieval.
* **Scalable and Cloud-Native**: Built with modern cloud architecture to ensure high availability, elasticity, and effortless scaling.
* **Seamless Deployment**: Follow step-by-step instructions to deploy the entire solution with minimal effort.

## Use Case

This Natural Language Voice Assistant is tailored for healthcare workers as a patient pre-screening application.
Some use cases are:

* Enable doctors to request a comprehensive summary of a patient's medical records before their scheduled appointment. The generated summary will provide the doctor with all relevant and essential information needed to facilitate informed decision-making during the consultation.
* Ensuring that critical patient dataâ€”such as past diagnoses, medications, allergies, and recent test resultsâ€”is readily available in a concise and accessible format.
* Streamline the pre-appointment review process.



ðŸ‘‰ Please note that this quick start builds a working AI infrastructure for you, but it's fueled by a small quantity of
fake data, so the results won't be at the level that you're accustomed to with AI applications such as Chat-GPT. Read the Next
Steps section at the end of this document to find out how you can tweak the architecture and improve or alter the AI
results.

## Architecture

**Future modifications to this Architecture diagram will be made.**

Architecture for handling audio, summarizing, building & executing query and chatbot functionality using a combination of Flink, Kafka Streams and Google APIs . Below is a breakdown of the architecture and its components:
![Architecture Diagram](./assets/arch.png)

### Natural Language Voice Assistant

This section demonstrates how the system interacts with user queries in real time.
1. **Frontend:** The frontend handles interactions with users. User audios are sent to a topic for further processing.
2. **Websocket:** Provides real-time communication between the frontend and backend for immediate responses.
3. **Model Inference:** Google Gemini is used for model inference to generate responses.
4. **Output to User:** The system sends the processed results back to the user via the websocket.

[//]: <> (change the key concepts accordingly - kept the embeddings since we will be using them)

### Key Concepts

1. **Embeddings:** These are vector representations of text, allowing the system to handle semantic search.

2. **Google Gemini:** Used for both summarization and generating responses in natural language.

## Requirements

### Docker

The `deploy` script automates the entire build process; the only required software is Docker.
Docker can be installed by following the official instructions - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
---
## Access Keys to Cloud Services Providers

After installing `docker`, the next step is to obtain the necessary authentication keys for the respective cloud service providers (CSPs).

### Confluent Cloud

![Creating Confluent Cloud Api Keys](./assets/cc-api-keys.gif)

For Confluent Cloud, a *Cloud Resource Management* API key is required.

If an account is not already set up, sign up first. Then, navigate to the top-right corner menu (also known as the hamburger menu) and select *API Keys* to generate the required key.

![cc-api-keys](./assets/cc-api-keys.png)

Click the *+ Add API key* button, select *My Account* and click the *Next* button (bottom right).
If you feel like it, enter a name and description. Click the *Create API Key* (bottom right).

---
### GCP
![Creating Confluent Cloud Api Keys](./assets/gcp-gemini-key.gif)

For Google Cloud, both a **Gemini API Key** and the **Project ID** are required.

If an account hasnâ€™t been created yet, sign up and navigate to the *Console* screen. The **Project ID** will be displayed just below the welcome messageâ€”be sure to save this for later use.

Next, open the top-left menu and select **APIs & Services**.  
Click the **Credentials** tab on the left, then click **+ Create Credentials** and choose **API Key**.  
Save this API key, as it will be required by the application when running the `deploy.sh` script.

---
## Run the Quickstart

### 1. Bring up the infrastructure

```
./deploy.sh
# Follow the prompts to enter your API keys and other credentials
```
```
GCP_REGION = "<region of your GCP project>"
GCP_PROJECT_ID = "<project id of your GCP - you have retrieved above>"
GCP_GEMINI_API_KEY = "<GCP Gemini API Key - you have retrieved above>"
GCP_ACCOUNT = "<email on your GCP account>"

CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY = "Confluent Cloud API Key - you have retrieved above"
CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET = "Confluent Cloud API Secret - you have retrieved above"
CONFLUENT_CLOUD_REGION = "Confluent Cloud region - default:us-east1"
```

### 2. Have a conversation!

Once the infrastructure is deployed, the Natural Language Assistant can be accessed by opening the frontend URL generated by Terraform.

For example, if the Terraform output is: 

```
Service URL: "https://quickstart-healthcare-ai-websocket-zsvndjdv4-666664333300.us-east1.run.app"
```

For the purposes of this quickstart, any username and password will be accepted, and after you log in to have a conversation hit the big record button.
# TODO add image or gif of this


#### 2a. Example Conversations
Let's assume the patient's name we have an appointment is Sheila Smith. Here are some example questions to ask:
- What are the summaries of recent appointments with Sheila Smith?
- What type of medicine Sheila Smith uses currently?
- What is the last diagnosis at the latest appointment of Sheila Smith?


### 3. Bring down the infrastructure

```
./destroy.sh
```
